## üéØ Project Title and Description

**Rectified Point Flow: Generic Point Cloud Pose Estimation Lab**

This application serves as an interactive lab environment designed to explore and compare different evaluation metrics used in pairwise point cloud registration. It specifically highlights the potential performance and concepts related to **Rectified Point Flow (RPF)** against various baseline methods.

Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision and robotics, involving the alignment of two partially overlapping 3D point clouds by finding a rigid transformation (rotation and translation). This lab provides visualizations and explanations to help users understand the quantitative assessment of different registration techniques.

**Key Objectives of this Lab:**

*   Gain a clear understanding of common point cloud registration evaluation metrics (RE, TE, Recall, RMSE, Overlap Ratio).
*   Interact with dynamic charts to explore performance data.
*   Understand basic data preprocessing and analysis concepts in 3D alignment.
*   Explore a user-friendly interface that explains core concepts of pose estimation and rigidity.

**Target Audience:**

Students, researchers, and professionals interested in computer vision, robotics, 3D geometry processing, and the quantitative evaluation of registration algorithms.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Metric Comparison Dashboard:**
    *   Visualize and compare Rotation Error (RE), Translation Error (TE), Recall@5¬∞, and Recall@1cm across different methods and datasets.
    *   Interactive filters for selecting specific datasets and methods.
    *   Detailed explanations and formulas for each metric.
*   **Rigidity Preservation Analysis:**
    *   Visualize and compare Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Overlap Ratio (OR) to assess how well methods preserve point cloud rigidity.
    *   Interactive filters for selecting specific datasets and methods.
    *   Detailed explanations and formulas for RMSE and OR.
    *   Conceptual 3D visualization illustrating point cloud alignment.
*   **Method Comparison:** Directly compare the performance of RPF (Single/Joint) with baseline methods like DCPNet, RPMNet, GeoTransformer, GARF, Diff-RPMNet, and PointDSC (based on provided dummy data).
*   **Dataset Exploration:** Analyze performance across different conceptual datasets like 'TUD-L' and 'ModelNet40' (based on provided dummy data).
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Utilize Plotly charts for dynamic data exploration.
*   **Informative Interface:** Provides context and explanations for key concepts and metrics.

*Note: The application uses dummy data for demonstration purposes. Real-world analysis would require loading actual performance data.*

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   `pip` package manager

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository_url>` and `<repository_name>` with the actual details if hosted on GitHub/GitLab etc. If not hosted, users would need the files directly).*

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```
    *(Assuming the `app.py` and `application_pages` folder are in this directory).*

3.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Create a `requirements.txt` file:**
    Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the root of your project directory and add the following lines:
    ```
    streamlit
    pandas
    plotly
    numpy
    ```

5.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üèÉ Usage

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated** (if you created one).
2.  **Run the Streamlit application** from the project root directory:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3.  Your web browser should automatically open a new tab displaying the application. If not, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

**Navigating the App:**

*   Use the **sidebar navigation** to switch between the "Metric Comparison Dashboard" and "Rigidity Preservation Analysis" pages.
*   On each page, use the **multiselect filters** to choose the Datasets and Methods you want to include in the visualizations.
*   On the Metric Comparison Dashboard, use the "Choose metrics to visualize" multiselect to select which performance charts you want to see.
*   Explore the charts by hovering over the bars to see specific values.
*   Read the accompanying text for explanations of the metrics and interpretation of the results.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ application_pages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metric_comparison.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rigidity_preservation.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
```

*   `app.py`: The main entry point for the Streamlit application. Handles the overall structure, navigation, loads initial data (dummy data in this case), and calls the specific page functions.
*   `application_pages/`: A directory containing modules for different pages/sections of the application.
    *   `__init__.py`: An empty file indicating that `application_pages` is a Python package.
    *   `metric_comparison.py`: Contains the Streamlit code for the "Metric Comparison Dashboard".
    *   `rigidity_preservation.py`: Contains the Streamlit code for the "Rigidity Preservation Analysis".
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the necessary Python libraries to run the application.

## üíª Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The core programming language.
*   **Streamlit:** Framework for building and deploying the web application.
*   **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis (handling the performance data).
*   **Plotly:** Used for creating interactive charts and visualizations (bar charts and 3D scatter plot).
*   **NumPy:** Used for numerical operations, particularly in the conceptual 3D visualization.
